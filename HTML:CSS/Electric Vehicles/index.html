<h2>History</h2>
<p class="tab"> Electric Vehicles have been around since the 19th century, yet they haven’t been quite popular until now as they have advanced their infrastructure, 
	and through those advancements, they have created many great impacts on the world and on us.The first working electric motor which consisted of 
	“a small locomotive that used two electromagnets, a pivot and a battery, was built by Thomas Davenport” in the United States during 1834 according to John Fuller on HowStuffWorks.
	Davenport’s electric vehicle was expensive because of the materials and didn’t catch on with other automobile companies back then. However, a few years later,
	Robert Anderson was credited with building the first ever crude-electric carriage.
	This sparked many other inventors to create electric vehicles in the future until improvements to the combustion engine were made and gasoline powered cars were introduced.
	It wasn’t until the mid-1900s when congress passed the Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1976 to reduce pollution and the use of oil as it 
	was becoming expensive and sparse. This increased research on electric and hybrid vehicles. With all the research, technological advancements, and shortages in gas, along with 
	Global warming issues, it wasn’t until the 21st century when automobile companies like Toyota created the Prius (which is a hybrid), Nissan Leaf, and the Chevy Volt. 
	H.	The biggest growth in electric vehicles was in 2012 when Elon Musk announced the Tesla Model S which was a luxurious electric sedan. The Model S had the longest range in any 
	electric vehicle and was technologically advanced as it had a huge screen on the dashboard which consisted of all the cars functions. Many other companies like Porsche, Volvo, and 
	even BMW started creating electric vehicles to compete against the Model S. Three years later, Tesla unveiled the Model X following with the Model 3 being the most affordable electric 
	vehicle for the average person like what Henry Ford did with his Model T only costing $650, cheaper than an electric or other gasoline powered car built.
